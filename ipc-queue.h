 * another IPC device (called remote) where the push/pop rings are reversed:
 *     local push_ring == remote pop_ring
 *     local pop_ring == remote push_ring
 *
 * The queue has freedom from interference between local and remote memory
 * domains by executing all write operations only in local memory (push_ring).
 * Read indexes of push_ring and pop_ring are swapped to avoid writing read
 * index in remote memory when doing pop operations.
 *
 * The queue is thread safe as long as only one thread is pushing and only one
 * thread is popping: Single-Producer - Single-Consumer. This thread safety
 * is lock-free and needs one additional sentinel element in rings between
 * write and read index that is never written.
